There are four types of constructors in Java:

Default constructor: A default constructor is a constructor that takes no parameters.
It is automatically provided by the Java compiler if no other constructors are defined.
Parameterized constructor: A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one
or more parameters. It is used to initialize the object with specific values.
Copy constructor: A copy constructor is a constructor that takes an object of the same
class as a parameter and initializes the new object with the same values as the passed object.
Private constructor: A private constructor is a constructor that can only be called from within
the class itself. It is used to prevent objects from being created outside of the class.
Here are some examples of the different types of constructors:

Default constructor:

Java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person() {
    }
}

Parameterized constructor:

Java
public

class

Person

{
    private String name;
    private

int age;

    public

Person(String name, int age)

{
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

Copy constructor:

Java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Person(Person other) {
        this.name = other.name;
        this.age = other.age;
    }
}
Use code with caution. Learn more
Private constructor:

Java
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    private Person() {
    }

    public static Person createPerson(String name, int age) {
        Person person = new Person();
        person.name = name;
        person.age = age;
        return person;
    }
}

Each type of constructor has its own specific use case. Default constructors are typically
used when the object does not need to be initialized with any specific values. Parameterized
constructors are used to initialize the object with specific values. Copy constructors are
used to create a copy of an existing object. Private constructors are used to prevent objects
from being created outside of the class.
